# GO API


This project is a simple project how to make an API in go.

I have separated the file based on their responsibility.

I have configured the routing and loging with the simple way!


routes:

http://localhost:9299/produk/ -> get Bukalapak product list (20 items)

http://localhost:9299/produk/{keyword} -> get Bukalapak product with keyword


Ps: Dont forget to go get first, then go build and go install

I use Bukalapak Open API as an example in this project :D
